**Last Updated: September 21, 2025**

## Data Collection

Siege Utils does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, user information, or usage analytics to external servers or third parties.

## Local Data Storage

- All extension functionality operates using data already visible on the siege.hackclub.com website
- Project statistics, efficiency calculations, and market preferences are stored locally on your device using Chrome's local storage
- No data leaves your device or is shared with any external services

## Data Usage

The extension only accesses information that is already displayed on the siege.hackclub.com website to:

- Calculate project efficiency metrics (coins per hour)
- Estimate reviewer bonuses and voter star ratings using mathematical algorithms
- Provide enhanced market interface with organized item categories
- Track project performance analytics and historical data
- Enable improved navigation and user interface enhancements

## Host Permission Usage

Siege Utils requires access to siege.hackclub.com to:

- Inject content scripts for displaying project statistics and market enhancements
- Read existing project data (coins, hours, weeks) from page elements
- Modify the user interface to show efficiency analytics and improved market layout
- Automatically update statistics when navigating between Siege pages

All processing occurs locally in your browser with no external data transmission.

## Third-Party Services

Siege Utils does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs beyond the existing siege.hackclub.com functionality.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your local device, you maintain complete control over your information. Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored extension data.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

Any updates to this privacy policy will be reflected in extension updates and posted to the Chrome Web Store listing.
